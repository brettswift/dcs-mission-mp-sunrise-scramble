# Mission Summary 

s mission is intended to be used with a few friends that spawn into slots at the start of the mission. 
Currently there isn't success criteria, but there are a few slots to hop into late in the mission if you get killed.

REQUIRED: You can play by yourself or with friends - but someone MUST take the top F18 slot in the list, as triggers etc are based on that plane. 

Progression: 

1. Dark startup 
2. Formation flight (dark & sunrise) ~10-15min 
    - escorted by F-14's (human slots available as well)
      - B1 bomber formation flies by - right now mostly for aesthetics :D 
      3. Sunrise AAR
      4. SEAD (wpt 3)
      5. Defend against enemy CAP   --OR--
         Strike more tanks
	 6. Super Carrier re-arm & re-fuel, and continue.
	 
	 
	 I expect lots of feedback, it probably isn't the type of mission you're used to.  Let me know how it can be better. 

# Mission Description

#####   IMPORTANT #######

This mission is designed for a multiplayer group if they spawn in at the same time.

## REQUIRED
Someone MUST take the first F18 slot in the list. Most triggers are designed off this plane. It's at the top of the list. 

## SINGLE PLAYER MODE

* when refuelling you can do the SEAD mission yourself - be sure to arm with a few HARM's to make it easier, the default loadout may have only AGM-65-F's. 
* If you want help with the SEAD mission, you can spawn 2 f18's via the f10 menu.  Only do this after refueling at the tanker (for best results).

## MULTIPLAYER MODE
* The first f18 is always required, but someone can get in a Tomcat if they want. 


### Late Spawns
There are a few spawns in Sukhumi and the Truman Super Carrier you can use to re-spawn.   There are also some slots that spawn in the air.

Navy Hornet  - Spawns fr om the Carrier (hot & cold), if you require  help eliminating Migs. 
Airborne hornet - in case you get shot down on the flight down to Sukhumi.   It'll spawn close to ARCO so you can do a short refuel.

A-10's etc at Sukhumi to finish off the strike mission.

## Briefing 

Intel has detected Red forces launch several aircraft and are expected to turn north to Anapa.   

The Shamgona island is developing a strong AA presence.  We anticipate they will build bridges around the island in an effort to secure the area  - specifically the hydro dam up river. 

We currently hold Sukhumi airbase, however they require help clearing the island of AA threats.  This is wh ere Colt comes in. 

We are also sending two groups of B1's to clean up enemy forces on the island.   Colt must succeed for the B1's to enter the area. 

A group of Tomcats will escort Colt before the SEAD strike commences. 

Two carriers are in the region and are expecting to refuel and resupply you.   There was a massive air battle which depleted their remaining air forces.

Colt flight must succeed, or we risk losing Sukhumi, and both Carrier Groups.
